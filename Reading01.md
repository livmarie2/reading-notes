### Reading Notes Reflection 01.

Github is super cool if you want an easy accessible website catered to your ideas and collections of footnotes,Â blogs etc.

here's some examples of how it transforms your thoughts into a visual representation of expression. 

_italics_ To emphasize how _important_ a word is in a given sentence. 

**bold text** to not only emphasize how important the text is but to also make sure you don't miss it. 

links are easy to also enter, all you do is type it in [jnfrfnf.com] and it turns blue, this is what it looks like iif you wanna rename said link to clean up your page a little bit [hi im link](https://hiimlink.com)

Github offers a basic syntax for a variety of different markdowns to try on your own. 
Github doesn't just allow one site, but a collectioin of pages onto one site. Kind of like it's your own little personal interweb that you're constantly sharing to the puiblic, but also able to make as many changes as you want to it as you go along seeing fit.
